# cryptic-machine
This is cyptic-machine project for AIU-Hackaton 2016!

### 21.04.2016 ###

Before getting started, I will prepare some files to start with here.

Project will have 3 sub parts, which we may include or exclude.
  - Brute force/dictionary attacker
  - Cipher encryptor and decryptor
  - Frequency analyzer for simple encrypted files
  
In Hackathon time we will mostly be building some of these attackers and user interfaces (mostly text based)
Some algorithms will be implemented beforehand.

###

#Description:
Cryptography is the writing of the messages in a concealed way, and also the set of techniques in order to find out what a hidden message is. 
In this project, we will develop simple cryptographic algorithms for encoding and decoding messages. It mostly consists in string manipulation and using lists and dictionaries in Python.

#Language used:
Python

#Learning objectives:
Develop programming skills in Python (strings, lists, functions, dictionaries)
Develop problem solving skills
Learn interesting encryption and decryption methods

#Encryption Methods:
Brute-force dictionary attack to passwords
Caesar-cipher and other Substitution ciphers
Frequency analyzer for ciphers

#Difficulty: 
Super Easy

#Requirements:
Very basic knowledge in Python
You may want to learn about some basic cryptography techniques like ciphers.
